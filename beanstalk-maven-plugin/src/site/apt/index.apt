What is it?

  For now, the Maven Beanstalk Plugin is a wrapper for the Amazon Beanstalk API for usage from Maven Projects.

Usage

  See the {{{./usage.html}Usage}} page. It describes the basic usage scenarios for beanstalk usage.
  
  Another interesting aspect is being able to deal with the configuration settings in Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Check {{{./configurations-and-templates.html}Configurations and Configuration Templates}} for further information.
  
  Also, check the settings for {{{./setup-for-ci.html}Setup for Continuous Integration}} docs as well.
